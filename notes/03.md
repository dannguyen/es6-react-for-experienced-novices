# Writing JSX with DataRow

https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html

> You don't have to use JSX with React. You can just use plain JS. However, we recommend using JSX because it is a concise and familiar syntax for defining tree structures with attributes.

> It's more familiar for casual developers such as designers.

> XML has the benefit of balanced opening and closing tags. This helps make large trees easier to read than function calls or object literals.

> It doesn't alter the semantics of JavaScript.



## DatumRow

src/app/components/DatumRow.jsx

### className, not class


```js
import React from 'react';

export class DatumRow extends React.Component{
  render(){
    var d = this.props.datum;
    return(
      <tr>
        <td className="name">{d.name}</td>
        <td className="description">{d.description}</td>
      </tr>
    );
  }
};
export default DatumRow;
```


## Alter DataTable

### make_rows

Removing raw HTML:

```js
make_rows(){
  var rows = []
  this.props.records.forEach((item) => {
    rows.push(<DatumRow datum={item} />)
  });
  return rows;
}
```

### render

render is nicer

```js
render(){
  var rows = this.make_rows();
  return(
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {rows}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
```


## Adding a key

Warning:



```
    Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `DataTable`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
```


The app still works, but let's follow best practices:


# Dynamic children and responsible parents


> When React reconciles the keyed children, it will ensure that any child with key will be reordered (instead of clobbered) or destroyed (instead of reused).


Let's just make key be name, with the (wrong-headed, naive) assumption that names will be unique...

In DataTable.jsx:

```js
rows.push(<DatumRow key={item.name} datum={item} />)
```

The class DatumRow doesn't give a crap what its key is...it's the parent's responsibility.

From the docs:

> The key should always be supplied directly to the components in the array, not to the container HTML child of each component in the array.
